If you think you water usage is high, water leak is a possibility.

How to detect a water leak? 
----------------------------
 * Make sure ALL faucets and fixtures are turned off and closed for the entire house, including irrigation.
 * Go to your main water meter (usually near the front curb) and open the box (Don't be startled because of insects, frogs. Take a quick look before sticking your hand in.)
 * Check the meter itself to see if the dial is spinning at all. *Sometimes it barely twitches depending on water pressure at the street.*
 * If the meter dial is not spinning, there are no leaks.
 * If the meter is spinning and you are absolutely sure that all sources of water are turned off for the house, then you have a leak somewhere. Seek professional help

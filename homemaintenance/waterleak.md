If you think you water usage is high, water leak is a possibility.

How to detect a water leak? 
----------------------------
Make sure ALL faucets and fixtures are turned off and closed for the entire house, including irrigation.
Go to your main water meter (usually near the front curb) and open the box.
Check the meter itself to see if the dial is spinning at all. *Sometimes it barely twitches depending on water pressure at the street.*
If the meter dial is not spinning, there are no leaks.
If the meter is spinning and you are absolutely sure that all sources of water are turned off for the house, then you have a leak somewhere. Seek professional help

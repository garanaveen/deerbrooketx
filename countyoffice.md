### Vehicle Registration
Vehicle registration renewal can be done online. Create an account on [https://txt.texas.gov/](https://txt.texas.gov/) and link your vehicles.

To be able to register your vehicle (including online renewals every year), you need to get it inspected every year. [Vehicle Inspection Stations](./vehicleinspections.md)

### Drivers License
New residents are required to obtain a Texas driver license from the Texas Department of Public Safety within 90 days of moving to the state. You need this to file HomeStead exemption anyways. So, get it done sooner than later.

You first need to get your vehicles registered in Texas before you can get your drivers license. Plan accordingly.

## Another good reason to get your Texas Drivers License is because you can't file for HomeStead exemption without one.

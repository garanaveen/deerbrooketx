### Vehicle Registration
Vehicle registration renewal can be done online. Create an account on [https://txt.texas.gov/](https://txt.texas.gov/) and link your vehicles.

To be able to register your vehicle (including online renewals every year), you need to get it inspected every year. [Vehicle Inspection Stations](./vehicleinspections.md)

Unlike Drivers License, registering vehicles for the first time should have long waiting times. Just walk in in to the county office and get it registered.

Registering in the state of texas means, surrendering the title from your previous state and getting a new title from Texas state.

If you have auto/car loan, then this transfer of title happens behind the scenes. Keep your auto mortgage info handy. If no auto mortgage, you will have title which you need to surrender.

Be sure to take a ticket by registering at the kiosk when you enter to reserve your spot.

### Drivers License
New residents are required to obtain a Texas driver license from the Texas Department of Public Safety within 90 days of moving to the state.

You first need to get your vehicles registered in Texas before you can get your drivers license. Plan accordingly.

## Another good reason to get your Texas Drivers License sooner than later is, you can't file for HomeStead exemption without a Texas DL.

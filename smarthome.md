### Smart home devices
First step is to figure out which echosystem you want to be in - Google or Amazon as all the products you buy have a better integration with one or the other (or both).

## Security Cameras
* Few points to keep in mind - 
  - Do you need flood lights?
  - What is the monthly subscription charges?
* [Nest Cam](https://store.google.com/product/nest_cam_battery?hl=en-US) (Google echosystem)
* [Ring](https://trello.com/c/pOEZiZCh/1-prepay-irs-4k-in-march) (Amazon echosystem)

## Doorbells
* Few points to keep in mind - 
  - Is it compatible with your existing chime? (i.e. will my already installed chime ring on pressing the doorbell).
  - Is it wired of batter operated?

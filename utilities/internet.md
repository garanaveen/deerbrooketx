At this point in Phase2, Suddenlink seems to be the only internet service provider. Be sure to signup for their $200 promotion. They might send you a giftcard in the 5th month after signup and might need followups.
A lot of people seem to have disconnective issues with Suddenlink when you use the modem provided by them. Most have success when you buy the modem yourself.
TODO : Exact model of the modem people are using to fix the disconnectivity issue needs to be udpated here.


ATT Fiber will probably become available some time soon.
As of MAR2022, some people had luck with ATT. Call and ask.

# Where to get documents notarized?
Start with a bank where you hold account. Call them and ask if anyone is available.

Some of the other services where you can get notarized are,
 * Leander Municipal Court (201 N Brushy St, Leander, TX 78641) [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fb9kSF7UUXpeWCfc6). - Free of cost. Walk ins are allowed but might be best to call them before hand and ask for availability.
 * WellsFargo - Free. Don't need to hold an account. Call up and check for availability.
 * Chase Bank - Free (If you have an account with them?)
 * UPS - Charges a typical fee and need to take an appointment.

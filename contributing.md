I have choosen markdown to make it super easy to add info as you would like without having to know all the technical things.

I have tried to keep everything text based. No programming! I would appreciate if you could keep it that way.

If you think the info being added deserves a separate file, go ahead and create a new *.md file and link in index.md file as needed.

Leander goes through different phases based on which we need to change/limit the watering of our lawns.

As of MAR2022, leander is in Conservation Phase 2.

How should we conserve?

Watering once a week (according to the schedule below) is the most important rule to follow.

If your RESIDENTIAL STREET ADDRESS NUMBER ends in

1, 5, or 9 — Water* on Friday

2, 4, 6, or 8 — Water* on Wednesday

0, 3, or 7 — Water* on Sunday

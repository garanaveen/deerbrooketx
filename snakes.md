Here are a few things that might be attracting snakes to your yard:

* Presence of tall grass provides a perfect hiding spot for snakes - This is yet another reminder to keep your grass trimmed at all times.
* Leaving out old cat and dog food
* Sources of water - Having water around is a perfect spot to be in for snakes. Make sure you don't have water readily available around the house.
* Composting near your home - If you are a DIY person or love recycling, composting attracts both rodents and inturn snakes. Stay away from composting.


Extra efforts you can put to keep them away if this keeps you up at night.
* Some people who are facing the green belt have installed wire mesh with a weave opening no larger than a quarter of an inch.


Things to be careful about,

I have seens some incidents of snakes hiding in the water meter box or something similar. Be careful when you are opening such lids.

What to do when you see a snake near your house?
* Identify it.
* Relocate if it is venomous.
If you have a security camera, direct it at the snake so that you have some kind of indication of its activity.



Snake Identification,

Take a picture from a safe distance and post it here to get some info. If it turns out to be venomous, try to get it relocated.

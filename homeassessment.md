Q : How to check your home assessment for property taxes?
Visit https://search.wcad.org and search for your address.
You should see 2022 Market Value on the top right corner.


Q : The website says "Exemptions: HS", why wasn't I protected with 10% increase?
If you became a home owner in 2020, then you would have been eligible for HomeStead in 2021 (if it was your primary residence as of 1JAN2021) and you would have been protected by 10% HomeStead cap in 2022.
Unfortunately, if you closed in 2021 or 2022, you aren't protected and you are liable to pay property taxes based on market rate.

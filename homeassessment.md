Q : How to check your home assessment for property taxes?
A : Visit [https://search.wcad.org](https://search.wcad.org) and search for your address.
You should see 2022 Market Value on the top right corner.


Q : The website says "Exemptions: HS", why wasn't I protected with 10% increase?
A : If you became a home owner in 2020, then you would have been eligible for HomeStead in 2021 (if it was your primary residence as of 1JAN2021) and you would have been protected by 10% HomeStead cap in 2022.
Unfortunately, if you closed in 2021 or 2022, you aren't protected and you are liable to pay property taxes based on market rate.


Q : What can I do to reduce the property taxes?
A : You can protest online yourself or go with a company which does on your behalf. Most of these companies charge a %age fee based on how much your savings are if they succeed to reduce the property taxes. So, if they charge 50% of savings and you end up savings $1000 after they represent you, they charge $500. Be aware of this fact before signing up with anyone.

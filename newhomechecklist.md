All of these are optional. Just a checklist. Feel free to add to this.

  * Epoxy for Garage floor (Best if you could do it before you move in)

  * Metal edging for your lawns to stop burmuda grass to get in to your garden/flowerbed. The sooner you do it the better off you are.

  * Install security cameras. Install a smart doorbell.

  * Paint a Protector for a wooden fence (The sooner the better)

  * Get your home inspected before 1 year warranty expires (ideally after about 6 months of your closing).

This information is applicable to homeowners who bought their property in the last year.
 * If the assessment is very high compared to purchase price you can do [express-review](https://www.wcad.org/express-review-for-new-property-purchases) with wcad(Williamson Central Appraisal District).
   - When you submit for express review, they will adjust the assessment based on purchase price.
   - The next step is to accept their assessment. If you do this, you are basically agreeing to their assessment and can't protest online.
   - If you think, you might get a better assessment by protesting online, you shouldn't accept their assessment.

 * On the other hand, if the assessment is not very high compared to purchase price, your best bet is to do [online-protest](https://www.wcad.org/online-protest-filing).

If you closed you home in 2019 or before you probably anyways have HomeStead protection which caps the assessment increase by 10%. online-protest is still a good idea. If you never did a online-protest, you should explore that possibility.
